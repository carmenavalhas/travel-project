            <h2>Why Frigiliana?</h2>
            <h3>Frigiliana, one of the most beautiful villages in Spain</h3>
            <p>
              This is an impressive beautiful white-blue village with some
              hidden purples. Frigiliana is considered one of the most beautiful
              villages in Andalusia. All the little cobbled streets are
              decorated with a bunch of colourful plant pots all around. <br />
              Frigiliana belongs to this selected beautiful villages since
              January 2015. The Most Beautiful Towns in Spain encompasses those
              municipalities with less than 15,000 inhabitants that meet a
              series of essential requirements, among which are offering a
              quality natural or architectural heritage, in addition to others
              attractions and demands, such as urban homogeneity, harmony in the
              buildings and materials of the facades and roofs, in addition to
              other aspects such as the hotel, festive, leisure, cultural offer,
              etc.
              <br />
              <br />
              Along some walks we can witness the doors and windows painted with
              pastel colours and tiny details. In the end of the hills of some
              streets we can be lost in the viewpoints. Once it is situated
              three hundred metres above sea level we can notice a marvellous
              breath taking landscape to contemplate.
              <br />
              <br />
              In my opinion there’s no much more to do in this tiny spot than to
              have a meal and a glass of wine; or even taste some tapas with a
              view after taking some walks. So, half a day is enough to visit
              all the village, take some pictures and enjoy the environment.
              <br /><br />
              No doubt, it is a mandatory trip if you are staying in Malaga for
              a few days as I was. If you are looking for peace for a few days,
              this is absolutely perfect to stay as well.
              <br />
              <br />

            <h3>A peek on Nerja</h3>
            <p>
              Nerja is a village and municipality 50km way from the province of
              Malaga. Unfortunately I didn’t have much time to visit the village
              of Nerja. I spent around 2hours there while I was waiting for the
              bus to Frigiliana. I’m glad I saw the Balcony of Europe which is a
              famous landmark. It is a viewpoint that offer a panoramic view of
              the town and also a spectacular view across the sea.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <h2>How to go:</h2>
            <p>
              If you are staying in Malaga without a car, the best way to go
              there is by bus. You should buy the tickets in the main bus
              station to Nerja and then buy there the tickets to Frigiliana –
              they are really cheap. Unfortunately the times from Nerja to
              Frigiliana aren’t so frequent so make sure you pay attention to
              the time table next to the bus stops before going to Frigiliana.
              You can visit the town in the meanwhile. From Frigiliana to Nerja
              the scenarium is the same or even worst. So we took a Taxi to
              Nerja.
